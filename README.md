## Tools
- Excel - Data Cleaning

 ## Data Cleaning/Preparation
 In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
 1. Data loading and inspection
 2. Handling missing values (such as uploading the exchange rate and the location of the different countries)
 3. Data cleaning and formatting

 ## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as: 

 - What is the overall sales and profit trend?
 - Which country contributed most to sales and profit?

## Recommendations 
- Focus on promoting and expanding the Car Division to maximize car sales.
- Consider bundling and upselling Cars Part with Cars as to boost revenue in the Car Parts Division. Investigate the types of cars with the most sales and provide access and affortability of those cars parts to   
  customers.
- Investigate operations in Germany, as that company location has not produced any revenue since Year 2021.

## Limitations
I had remove all zero values from the budget and revenue columns because they would have affected the accuaracy of my conclusions from the analysis.
