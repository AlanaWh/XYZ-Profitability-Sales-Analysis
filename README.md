 2. Handling missing values (such as uploading the exchange rate and the location of the different countries)
 3. Data cleaning and formatting

 EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as: 

 - What is the overall sales and profit trend?

## Recommendations 
- Focus on promoting and expanding the Car Division to maximize car sales.
- Consider bundling and upselling Cars Part with Cars as to boost revenue in the Car Parts Division. Investigate the types of cars that sell the most and provide access and affortability of those cars parts to   
  customers.
- Investigate operations in Germany, as that company location has not brought in any revenue since Year 2021.

## Limitations
I had remove all zero values from the budegt and revenue columns because they would have affected the accuaracy of my conclusions from the analysis.
